# Mini TCP

Mini TCP is a simplified, educational implementation of a TCP-like protocol written in C.

It reproduces the fundamental mechanisms of TCP, including connection establishment, flow control, acknowledgment handling, and congestion management,
offering an in-depth look at how reliable data transmission works under the hood.
